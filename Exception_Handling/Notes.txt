- try/catch in java , try/except in python.
- python runs code line by line, it is an intepreted language.
- when we want to run important code and know that this is an error prone code
we can surround it inside try/except block and prevent program from crashing.
- When testing, if user mistakenly gives an unwanted input, we donont want
the user program to be crashed rather show a validation notification message.
- Therefore we will be able to still run the program successfully even if there is
unwanted error.
- only put codes that are error prone in the try block.
- put the correct code in the else block.
- finally blocks always execute whether it is an error or not.
- can raise exception manually as well.
